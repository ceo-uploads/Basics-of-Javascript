// chapter 60b - Below the return statement, log the string "This works!" to the console.

// After doing that, you will see that the string "This works!" does not display in the console,
// and the console.log("This works!") line is greyed out.

// Copy the console log and paste it above the return statement.Now, the string "This works!" should appear in the console.

// An important thing to know about the return keyword is that it does not just define a value to be returned from your
// function, it also stops the execution of your code inside a function or a block statement.
// This means any code after a return statement will not run.
